# Documentation


## API reference

When you're using a language that has established support for docstrings,
always write them for the public functions (methods, classes, ...). The
docstring should contain a description of what the function does and what the
arguments mean. It's fine to keep it brief.

Do it always so you don't have to guess which functions' meanings are obvious.
It's fine to write docstrings for private functions, too.


## README

README should tell you at least the following:

* how to install everything you need to build and run the project
* how to build the project
* how to run the tests
* how to install and run the project
* where to find the documentation

For open source projects, it should also tell you:

* how to report a bug
* how to contribute
* what's the license

## CHANGELOG

Always keep a human-readable changelog. Highlight the breaking changes. If you
need a template, see [Keep a CHANGELOG](http://keepachangelog.com/en/).
